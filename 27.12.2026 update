so basically it just crashed right after i hand launched it
it turned mid way and came firing down, at that moment i was surprised and moreover filled with sadness
although it was not the first time that i failed but i was deeply sad by the outcome because i had high expectations with it
but on the bright side , i learned very important things that i will implement in my next rc plane which are - size, importance of C.G, and aerodynamics
i will be back soon with a better and working plane
