An RC F115 flying wing project built with an A2212 2200 KV brushless motor, a 30 A ESC, FlySky FS‑i6X transmitter, and SG90 servos is a compact, high‑thrust setup where the motor and ESC provide reliable power for a 6×3–6×4.5 prop on a 3S 1500–2200 mAh LiPo, the FS‑i6X handles elevon mixing for smooth pitch and roll control, and the two SG90 servos drive the elevons with enough authority for agile maneuvers; the battery placement is used to fine‑tune the center of gravity (around 20–25% of the wing chord), while elevons are set with slight reflex for stability, making the wing efficient at cruising on half throttle yet capable of punchy climbs at full power, provided the ESC’s BEC can reliably support the servos, and overall this combination yields a lightweight, responsive wing ideal for both fun flights and skill‑building in RC flying.
